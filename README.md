Hi there!

1. The HEKA to MatLab Importer is needed for this Script to work.
2. HEKA Data has to be in .dat Format
3. Each Cell should have its own .dat File
4. Recordings where Patchmaster crashed have to be treted with care!!!
   4.1 Here besides the .dat file also other files with the same name but different ending (like .pul) are generated.
   Those have to be included in the current MatLab Folder so that the Importer can pull all nessecary Data from those files.
   When you close Patchmaster normaly this is done by the Software itself.
